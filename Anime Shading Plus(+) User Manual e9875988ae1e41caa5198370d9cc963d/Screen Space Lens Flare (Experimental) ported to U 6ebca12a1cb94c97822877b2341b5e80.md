# Screen Space Lens Flare (Experimental) ported to Unity 2021/2022

# **About Screen Space Lens Flare**

---

Starting with Unity 2023, Screen Space Lens Flare is a built-in post-processing effect in SRP.

I personally like this effect very much, so I decided to port this feature to earlier versions of Unity, so that even Unity 2021/2022 users can use this feature. Screen Space Lens Flare relies on the final RT output of **Bloom**, so you must turn on **Bloom** for it to take effect.

Because it is ported backward in a bit of a hacky way, this feature is regard as experimental. At this point, I cannot guarantee that this feature will not have bugs in the editor/buit player of 2021/2022.

ðŸ’¡ In some cases, when the **streak threshold** in the screen space lens flare volume is too low, there may be flickering when moving the mouse in the editor.
