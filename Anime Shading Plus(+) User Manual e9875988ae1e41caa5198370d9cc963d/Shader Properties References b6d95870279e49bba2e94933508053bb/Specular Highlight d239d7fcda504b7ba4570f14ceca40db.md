## StylizePBR Mode Properties

---

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ In StylizePBR mode, the color and intensity of the specular reflection light will be calculated using the standard PBR BRDF model. The color and intensity of the specular reflection light will vary according to the material's metallic and smoothness properties in BRDF model. 

However, you can still adjust the Specular Size and Specular Falloff parameters to make the specular reflection look more like a cartoon rendering effect. 

When using StylizePBR, if you want to control the area like the specular mask in the CelShading mode, you need to modify the metallic textureâ€™s metallic value to control the area of metallic material.
