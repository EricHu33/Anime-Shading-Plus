| Property Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Alpha Clipping | Controls whether to enable Alpha Test. Pixels with a texture alpha value (or Dithering) lower than the threshold will be discarded. |
| Alpha Clipping Threshold | The threshold for Alpha Clipping |
| Dithering Factor | The strength of the Dither pseudo-transparency effect. Alpha Clipping must be enabled before using this. |
| Dither Pixel Size | The size of the dither pattern in screen pixel unit. |
| Surface Type | Surface type (transparent or opaque ) |
| Render Face | The mesh face to be rendered (Front, Back, Both) |
| Perspective FOV Offset | Controls the effect of correcting the perspective projection FOV deformation. The default is 0 for no correction, and adjusting to 1 will approach orthographic projection. |

ðŸ’¡ The **Perspective FOV Offset** and **Dithering Factor** of all materials of the current character can be uniformly set and managed in the UI of the ASP Character Panel. This allows for easier management of material ball parameters.
