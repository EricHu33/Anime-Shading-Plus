# Object Space Outline Settings

![Untitled](Object%20Space%20Outline%20Settings%209d066f2426a644ed99fb32649bb5404d/Untitled.png)

This page will explain how to set up object space outlines based on inverted hulls method, and how to use the smooth normal bake tools provided by ASP to improve the quality of outlines.

# 1. **Enable ASP Mesh Outline Renderer Feature**

---

To use object space outlines, you must add the **ASP Mesh Outline** Renderer Feature to the URP Renderer data. The setup process is as follows:

![Untitled](Object%20Space%20Outline%20Settings%209d066f2426a644ed99fb32649bb5404d/Untitled%201.png)

After adding the ASP Mesh Outline renderer feature, back to the current character's **ASP Character Panel**. At this time, **Mesh Outline** in the Check List should show **Active**.

<aside>
üí° The Check List in the GUI of the **ASP Character Panel** displays the current status of **ASP Mesh Outline**. If it is not enabled, you can quickly point to the current URP Renderer data by clicking the **Open URP Data** button.

# 2. Use Layer/RenderingLayerMask to control where outlines appear on the character.

The GUI under Shadow Behaviour category allows you to directly observe all the layers and rendering layer masks specified by the current ASP passes. 

In the above figure, the **Layer** specified by the pass that draws the mesh outline is **Default**, and the specified **rendering layer mask** is **Outline**. Renderers that satisfy this combination will be rendered to the outline pass.

# 3. **Adjust the MeshOutline pramaters**

In the **ASP Character Panel**, under the **Mesh Outline Param** category, you can control the extrude method of the outline for the renderer that is rendered to the model space outline pass, along with some other paramters that give further control of the object space outline.

| Property Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Current Extrude Method | Outline extrusion mode |
|      - FROM_VERTEX_NORMAL | Extrude the model space outline along the vertex normal direction |
|      - FROM_UV4 | Use the value stored in UV4 of the model vertex as the extrusion direction |
| Mesh Outline Color | Model space outline color |
| Mesh Outline Width | The extrusion distance of the model space outline (can be seen as the outline width) |
| Fade Out Start End Distance | Outline fade-in start distance and fade-out maximum distance |
| Bake Smooth Normal Field | Expand to display bake smooth normal option |
| Smooth Target | Target model file to be baked (FBX, OBJ) |
| Quick Find | Quickly search for the model file of the current character object |
| Bake Normal Into UV4 | Bake the smoothed normal and store it in UV4 of the current character model |

# 4.Baking smoothed normal

The outline relies on the model's normal information for extrusion. However, unsmoothed normals or vertices with sharp angles can cause the outline to appear broken (as shown in left side of above figure). To address this, ASP provides a tool that bakes smoothed normal information into the model's UV4 channel, which can then be read by the vertex shader.

üí°  The model's UV map starts from 0: uv0, uv1, uv2... and so on. Therefore, the uv4 channel is actually the fifth UV channel of the model.

**Steps to bake the smooth normal :** 

1. In the ASP Character Panel, click to expand the **Bake Smooth Normal Field** .
2. Assign the **Smooth Target**, by select the model file (FBX, OBJ) you want to bake.
3. Click the **Bake Normal Into UV4** button.
4. Wait for a few seconds to bake.
5. Change the **Extrude Mode** to ***FROM_UV4** and click **Apply.***

**How to quickly find the FBX file of the current character object
     - Click** the **Quick Find** button next to **Smooth Target** field.

<aside>
üí° After baking, an FBX file named "character_model_name@smoothRef" will be generated in the same folder as the original FBX. This file serves as a reference for the smoothed normals and should be kept. If deleted, you can regenerate it by baking again. 

The normal baking script requires the package "com.unity.collections" (version 1.5.1 or later) for proper functionality.
