# Optimizing Skinned Mesh Renderer Performance in Unity

ThisÂ sectionÂ outlinesÂ methodsÂ toÂ improveÂ GPUÂ andÂ CPUÂ performanceÂ withinÂ Unity when working with Skinned Mesh Renderer.

### MethodsÂ forÂ LimitedÂ GPUÂ Optimization

TheseÂ techniquesÂ offerÂ improvementsÂ toÂ GPUÂ performance:

- **ReduceÂ Feature/TextureÂ Count:**Â MinimizeÂ theÂ numberÂ ofÂ featuresÂ andÂ texturesÂ usedÂ withinÂ yourÂ materials.
- **LimitÂ EdgeÂ DetectionÂ Types:**Â DecreaseÂ theÂ types ofÂ edgeÂ detectionÂ methodsÂ that being enabled.

### **Significant CPU and GPU Performance Optimization**

- Reduce the number of vertices count and vertex data in skinned meshes
- Set LOD for skinned meshes
- Enable GPU Skinning (when not GPU-bound)
- Merge different materials in the same character to reduce the total number of skinned mesh renderers and materials

# Skinned Mesh LOD Example

---

The following is an example of a CPU skinning (Unity default setup) project with 15 characters (each character model has 19,000 faces) on the scene.
Runtime FPS is approximately 85

After using three levels of LOD, FPS is approximately 120, which shows a significant improvement for the CPU.

# GPU Skinning

---

Unity provides a **GPU Skinning** feature that can significantly improve performance by transferring skinning calculations from the CPU to the compute shader on the GPU. If the target hardware/platform has a dedicated GPU (graphics card) and the project is not GPU-bound, this option can also significantly improve performance.

Using three levels of LOD + Enabling GPU Skinning - Performance improvement to approximately 200FPS
