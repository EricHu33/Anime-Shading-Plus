# **Rights of Character Models**

**Please note:** I did not create any of the character models in this document. These models are only used to demonstrate the various Shader features within ASP. To better showcase certain features, I have made some modifications to the UVs or materials of the models.

**When purchasing from the store, only [早川 葵 - Hayakawa Aoi]** will be included in the Package as a demo character inside the demo scenes.(with the original author's permission).
