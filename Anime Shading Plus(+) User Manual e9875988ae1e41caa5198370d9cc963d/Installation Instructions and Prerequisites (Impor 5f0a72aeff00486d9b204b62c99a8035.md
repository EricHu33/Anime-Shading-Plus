# Installation Instructions and Prerequisites (Important)

## 1. **Install the corresponding Universal Render Pipeline (URP) version**

---

If you install URP manually in Unity's Package Manager, different URP versions will be installed for the following Unity versions:

- Unity 2021.3 LTS ‚Üí URP 12
- Unity 2021.3 LTS ‚Üí URP 14
- Unity 2023.2+ ‚Üí URP 16

For detailed installation steps, please refer to:

[Installing the Universal Render Pipeline into an existing Project | Universal RP | 12.1.14](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@12.1/manual/InstallURPIntoAProject.html)

üí°  **Please note that if the URP project itself is created directly from the URP category within Unity Hub, you should pay special attention to the Quality URP Asset settings section in this page**

## 2. Configure URP Asset for ASP(Anime Shading +)

1)URP Asset

The URP asset stores various global graphics settings, including shadow map size/rendering distance, multi-light support, and more.

## 3. Quality Level and URP Asset

Quality Setting

The same project can have different Quality Levels configured with their own corresponding URP assets. If you create a URP project directly from the URP category in the Unity Hub, there will already be 4-6 different URP assets built-in. Often, users find that the shader effect is missing after building the executable, turns out the quality of the build target itself uses a different URP asset than the one used in the Editor.

## **4. Add ASP renderer features to the current Universal Renderer Data**

2)Universal Renderer Data

The URP asset points to a Universal Renderer Data (see top of Figure 1) - this renderer data contains the settings for various render passes in the current pipeline. For example, forward/deferred rendering. Custom post processing passes in URP, etc. The additional renderer features included in ASP need to be configured in this renderer data too.

There are a total of 3 basic renderer features required by ASP. Please be sure to add and enable the following renderer features in the renderer data:

---

- ASP Material Pass
- ASP ShadowMap
- ASP Depth-Offset Shadow

The following renderer features included in ASP plugin are optional. If you need the corresponding functionality, add and enable them to the current renderer data:

- ASP ToneMapping - After adding, you can add the Tonemapping effect specially designed for cartoon rendering characters in the camera volume.
- ASP Sreen Space Outline - After adding, you can add the screen space outline in ASP to the camera volume.
- ASP Mesh Outline - After adding, you can use mesh-based outlines.

# 5. **Verify package dependencies**

---

If you need to use the smooth normal tool for mesh-based outline function, It is required to install unity.collection package as well. Search for **collection** in the Package Manager and install it (version must be greater than 1.5.1).

If you are using Unity 2021, or the default version of the collections package is less than 1.5.1, please follow below steps to manually install the specified version of the collections package:

1. Open the Package Manager in the Unity Editor.
2. Click the "+" icon in the upper left corner of the package manager window and select¬†**Add package from git URL**.
3. In the URL field, enter¬†**com.unity.collections@1.5.1**¬†and click¬†**Add**.
